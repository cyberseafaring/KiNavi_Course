Born out of research on packet-based networks during the 1950s, the original ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) had evolved from its humble introduction in 1969 into a far more robust Internet Protocol (IP) network (IP, along with Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, serves as the protocol for establishing a virtual connection between devices or systems). An ongoing series of technical advances—as well as massive leaps in computing power —led a legion of private groups to push for an open Internet. After the US government decommissioned the network, then known as the National Science Foundation Network, a new era was born. The framework for global connectedness had been established. ",

In 1946, Chester Gould introduced the two-way watch radio in his Dick Tracy comic strips. The wristwatch communicator became a mainstay of the strip—and it clearly captured the public’s imagination. Then, during the 1940s, researchers at Bell Labs, including Amos Joel Jr., W. Rae Young, and D. H. Ring, engineered a system that allowed callers to talk and exchange data while in motion. The technology allowed a communications device to connect to different cell towers—and switch towers based on location. ",

Installing systems to control lights and appliances required a great deal of time and a willingness to tweak, tinker and adjust settings. Getting everything to work together was sometimes nothing short of torturous. Pico Electronics in Scotland developed one of the earliest standards, X10, in 1975. Among other things, it developed the first single-chip calculator, a programmable turntable for playing vinyl records and a remote control for lights and appliances. Later, the firm adapted the X10 interface to work with personal computers. Although the X10 protocol demonstrated what was possible using home automation, it never took off and, over the years, has drifted into relative obscurity on the home automation front. It was simply too expensive and too clunky. ",

For instance, the Z-Wave wireless communications platform uses low-power radio frequency waves in the 900 Megahertz range to connect electronic devices, including lighting, access controls, thermostats, security devices, smoke alarms, and appliances. It is optimized for low latency and high reliability, which means it provides dependable and persistent connections between devices. In addition it exchanges small data packets at rates as high as 100 kilobytes per second. As a result it is not subject to interference from surrounding Wi-Fi and Bluetooth systems. More than 160 manufacturers now produce products using Z-Wave technology. ",

ZigBee focuses on low-cost, low-speed communication between devices. It essentially works within a 10-meter area (approximately 33 feet) and delivers a maximum transfer rate of about 250 kilobytes per second. The platform, which uses 128-bit encryption to protect data, can transmit signals through intermediate ZigBee devices to reach more distant devices—thus creating a mesh network (where all devices or nodes can relay data to the network). This makes ZigBee best suited for applications that use low data rates and only intermittent transmissions. Thus ZigBee is now widely used for wireless ad hoc networks incorporating light switches, thermostats, electrical meters, health monitoring devices, and a variety of commercial and industrial systems. The ZigBee Alliance in fact boasts more than 600 products from over 400 companies. ",

This makes it possible to bypass obstructions and interference that results from steel, concrete, and other objects that often block radio waves. Rather than adopting a command-and-control approach to managing devices, Insteon, which can transmit at a relatively fast rate of 38,400 bits per second, relies on a peer-to-peer approach. Within the network, each nonbattery device serves as a two-way repeater, meaning that the system can find the fastest available route to exchange data within the network.

In Finland, for example, sensors in trash bins now send a message to a truck when a pickup is required. This has led to a 40 percent savings in waste collection costs. In Nice, France, a smart parking system alerts drivers about open spots on a real-time basis. The system has already reduced traffic congestion and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. But these represent fairly crude capabilities measured against future possibilities. For example, autonomous vehicle networks would allow far more vehicles to travel on roads—in many cases caravans could travel only inches apart—with an almost infinitesimal risk of collision. But the system could also adjust traffic lights and redirect vehicle flows as conditions change. The resulting cost savings and emissions reductions would likely reach into billions or trillions of dollars a year. ",

What’s more, studies show that many motorists tend to use automation features, such as adaptive cruise control, incorrectly.

They’ve commandeered their way into refrigerators and television sets—sending spam and secretly taking control of these devices. Meanwhile researchers have hacked automobiles and medical devices to demonstrate vulnerabilities. The former could lead to an inability to steer or brake a vehicle. The latter could cause a defibrillator or insulin pump to fail. ",

I don’t see robots as a solution—for robots cannot give us the love and care we need and deserve. I see our preoccupation with ‘caring machines’ as a symptom for how we have disappointed each other. … The fantasy is that we will somehow ‘offload’ or ‘outsource’ those things that we are finding hard to keep up with as a society.” In the end, the irony is that we embrace technology such as the Internet and the IoT to make our lives simpler and easier but the result is exactly the opposite. “We turn to technology to help us find time. But we end up spending more time with technology and less with each other. And there, again, is the vicious circle.” ",

A growing body of research shows that rising levels of depression and dissatisfaction in society can at least partially be attributed to diminished human contact and connections.

After all, in the end, no matter how many devices and machines we have and how connected we are—we are human beings. It’s doubtful whether any robot or system, at least in the foreseeable future, will match human complexity and thinking. ",
